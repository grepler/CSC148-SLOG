# CSC148-SLOG
Student Learning Journal for CSC148 at the University of Toronto. Hopfully I can learn Git while I'm at it.

The SLOG Guidelines indicate that on week 3 we will have started to write our CourSe LOGS. What an apt name. So far we haven't covered much material and I wish there was a more complete textbook, that being said the pdf linked-to on the course website is a nice overview and is a good jumping-off point for further research.
I spent most of the previous class reading about Python Decorators and Closures, which seem very useful but I still don't have a handle on.

GitHub seems like a very interesting tool, I'm looking forward to exploring the text highlighting and version control structures.

``` python
print('hello GitHub!')
```
