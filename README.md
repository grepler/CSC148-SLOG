# CSC148-SLOG
Student Learning Journal for CSC148 at the University of Toronto. Hopefully I can learn Git while I'm at it.

The SLOG Guidelines indicate that on week 3 we will have started to write our CourSe LOGS. What an apt name. So far we 
haven't covered much material and I wish there was a more complete textbook, that being said the pdf linked-to on the 
course website is a nice overview and is a good jumping-off point for further research.
I spent most of the previous class reading about Python Decorators and Closures, which seem very useful but I still 
don't have a handle on.

GitHub seems like a very interesting tool, I'm looking forward to exploring the text highlighting and version 
control structures.

``` python
print('hello GitHub!')
```

It appears that my previous commits weren't being pushed up to the GitHub project, so I'll have to take a look at that.
In the meantime, I've learned a lot about how to merge commits and forks into the master by using GitHub to manage the private repositories for Assignments 1 and 2. They're kind enough to permit five private repositories to University students.

Our network graph looks like this:
